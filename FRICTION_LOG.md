# üî• Friction Log - AI Operations Command Center

## Overview
This document tracks challenges encountered during development and how they were resolved.

---

## üêõ Challenge 1: OpenAI Package Version Conflicts

**Issue**: ImportError with `httpx` and `openai` packages
ImportError: cannot import name 'BaseTransport' from 'httpx'

text

**Root Cause**: Incompatible versions between `openai` and `httpx` packages

**Solution**:
pip install httpx==0.27.2
pip install openai==1.52.0

text

**Learning**: Always specify compatible versions in `requirements.txt`

---

## üîë Challenge 2: OpenAI API Model Access

**Issue**: Error 404 - Model not found
openai.NotFoundError: The model gpt-4-turbo-preview does not exist

text

**Root Cause**: Free tier OpenAI accounts don't have access to GPT-4 models

**Solution**: Switched to `gpt-3.5-turbo` model which is available on free tier

**Alternative**: Implemented rule-based priority scoring as backup (actually more reliable!)

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Challenge 3: Composio SDK Version Migration

**Issue**: Cannot import `Action` from composio package
ImportError: cannot import name 'Action' from 'composio'

text

**Root Cause**: Composio migrated from v0.x to v2.x with breaking changes

**Solution**: 
- Updated imports to use string-based action names
- Changed from `Action.GMAIL_SEARCH` to `"GMAIL_SEARCH"`
- Implemented fallback mock responses

---

## üóÑÔ∏è Challenge 4: Database Path Issues

**Issue**: SQLite database not persisting across runs

**Root Cause**: Relative path interpretation in different directories

**Solution**:
DATABASE_URL=sqlite:///./operations.db # Relative to project root

text

**Learning**: Use absolute paths or project-relative paths consistently

---

## üîê Challenge 5: API Key Management

**Issue**: Accidentally exposed API keys in early commits

**Solution**:
- Created `.gitignore` with `.env` entry
- Removed keys from git history
- Created `.env.example` template
- Documented API key setup in README

**Learning**: Set up `.gitignore` BEFORE first commit!

---

## üåê Challenge 6: CORS Issues with FastAPI

**Issue**: Browser blocked API calls from frontend testing

**Solution**:
from fastapi.middleware.cors import CORSMiddleware

app.add_middleware(
CORSMiddleware,
allow_origins=[""],
allow_methods=[""],
allow_headers=["*"],
)

text

**Learning**: Configure CORS early when building APIs

---

## üì¶ Challenge 7: Virtual Environment Confusion

**Issue**: Packages installing to global Python instead of venv

**Root Cause**: venv not properly activated in PowerShell

**Solution**:
.\venv\Scripts\activate # Windows

Verify: which python should show venv path
text

**Learning**: Always verify venv activation before pip install

---

## üîß Challenge 8: Pydantic Settings Validation

**Issue**: `extra_forbidden` error when adding new config fields

**Solution**: Add `extra = 'ignore'` to Pydantic Config class
class Config:
extra = 'ignore'

text

---

## ‚è±Ô∏è Challenge 9: Background Task Management

**Issue**: Background monitoring blocking server startup

**Solution**: Used `asyncio.create_task()` for non-blocking execution

---

## üìù Challenge 10: Notion Database ID Extraction

**Issue**: Confusion between page ID and database ID

**Solution**: Database ID is the 32-character hex string in URL AFTER page name and BEFORE `?v=`

---

## üéØ What Worked Well

‚úÖ **Composio Integration**: Once configured, seamless multi-tool orchestration
‚úÖ **FastAPI**: Excellent auto-documentation with Swagger UI
‚úÖ **SQLAlchemy ORM**: Clean database abstraction
‚úÖ **Rule-Based Priority**: More reliable than LLM for production use
‚úÖ **Tenacity Retries**: Automatic error recovery without manual intervention

---

## üí° Recommendations for Future Participants

1. **Start with `.env.example`**: Create this FIRST before writing any code
2. **Use compatible package versions**: Test with specific versions, not `latest`
3. **Implement fallbacks**: Always have a Plan B (mock data, rule-based alternatives)
4. **Test incrementally**: Don't wait until end to test integrations
5. **Document as you go**: Friction log is easier when written real-time

## ‚è∞ Time Investment

| Task | Estimated | Actual | Notes |
|------|-----------|--------|-------|
| Package setup | 30 min | 2 hours | Version conflicts |
| API integrations | 2 hours | 4 hours | OAuth complexity |
| Priority analyzer | 1 hour | 30 min | Rule-based simpler than LLM |
| Database setup | 30 min | 45 min | Path issues |
| Testing | 1 hour | 2 hours | Multiple iterations |
| **Total** | **5 hours** | **9.25 hours** | |

---

**Overall**: Despite challenges, Composio's Tool Router significantly reduced integration time. Building the same system with individual SDKs would have taken 20+ hours.
